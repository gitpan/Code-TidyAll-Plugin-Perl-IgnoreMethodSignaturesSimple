NAME
    Code::TidyAll::Plugin::Perl::IgnoreMethodSignaturesSimple - Prep
    Method::Signatures::Simple directives for perltidy and perlcritic

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        use Code::TidyAll::Plugin::Perl::IgnoreMethodSignaturesSimple

DESCRIPTION
    This tidyall plugin uses a preprocess/postprocess step to convert
    Method::Signatures::Simple (`method' and `function') to specially marked
    subroutines so that perltidy and perlcritic will treat them as such, and
    then revert them afterwards.

    The postprocess step also adds an empty parameter list if none is there.
    e.g. this

        method foo {

    becomes

        method foo () {
